      <p>A major investment of <strong>£17 million</strong> has been announced to expand special educational needs provision across the Liverpool City Region.</p>
      
      <p>Around a third of this funding (over <strong>£5.3 million</strong>) is earmarked for Liverpool city, to help create new specialist school places and upgrade facilities in line with growing demand.</p>
      
      <p>Local leaders welcomed the funding, noting it will support plans to ensure all children in Liverpool can access a high-quality education in a setting that meets their needs.</p>
      
      <p>This investment comes at a critical time, as the number of Liverpool children with Education, Health and Care Plans has roughly doubled in the past three years, putting significant strain on existing SEND resources.</p>
      
      <p>The funding will help address capacity issues and improve the quality of specialist education settings throughout the city, benefiting hundreds of children with special educational needs and their families.</p>
