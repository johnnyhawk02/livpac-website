      <p>Liverpool's council has unveiled plans for a new <strong>£37 million</strong> purpose-built special school in West Derby to replace the aging facilities of Princes Primary School, which currently serves children with profound multiple learning difficulties and autism across four separate sites.</p>
      
      <p>The proposed school, to be built on a long-derelict site off Princess Drive, would accommodate approximately <strong>250 pupils</strong> and greatly improve capacity for SEND education in the city.</p>
      
      <p>The impressive plans include modern amenities such as:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>Over 30 specialist classrooms</li>
        <li>Dedicated hygiene rooms with hoists</li>
        <li>Two hydrotherapy pools</li>
        <li>Rebound therapy and multisensory rooms</li>
        <li>A community café space</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>The single-story design aims for full accessibility, and there are plans to make facilities available to community groups and other SEN schools, creating a wider hub for SEND resources.</p>
      
      <p>The council cabinet is expected to approve the investment, responding to a 50% rise in Liverpool's EHCP pupil population since 2020.</p>
